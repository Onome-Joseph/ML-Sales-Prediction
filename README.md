# Sales Prediction Model
This repository contains a **Sales Prediction** Machine Learning Model built to predict sales for a given dataset of  features containing different goods/services of a business and their attributes.
# üìã Aim of the Project
The primary goal of this project is to develop a machine learning model capable of accurately predicting sales. By leveraging advanced regression techniques and feature engineering, the model empowers businesses to:
- Optimize their sales strategies.
- Anticipate revenue.
- Make data-backed decisions to maximize profitability.
# Algorithms Used:
- XGBoost Regression: A powerful gradient boosting technique for accurate predictions.
- Polynomial Features Transformation: For capturing non-linear relationships in the data.
# üí° Applications
- Inventory Management: Prevents overstocking or understocking by predicting demand accurately.
- Marketing Optimization: Assists in targeting campaigns based on predicted sales spikes or drops.
- Resource Allocation: Helps allocate resources to maximize profit based on expected sales patterns.
# üìù Conclusion
This Sales Prediction Model is a practical solution for businesses to leverage data-driven insights, enabling them to enhance decision-making, and achieve a competitive edge in their market.
